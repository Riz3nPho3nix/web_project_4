# Project 4: Around The U.S.

And now, we code!!

Project 4 is an introduction to Javascript. We learned about a few new things:

* DOM - Document Object Model

* Getting data from HTML with querySelector()

* Editing HTML markup with innerHTML and editing classes

* Creating event handlers to update the markup when a button is clicked

# Project 5: More Around the U.S.

Javascript; arrays; functions; oh, my!

For project 5 we continued adding functionality to our [Around the U.S.](https://riz3npho3nix.github.io/web_project_4) website.

Some of the new features include:

* Using a template to display repeated code on the page

* Manipulation of arrays

* using figure tag to display an image with caption
