# Project 4: Around The U.S.

And now, we code!!

Project 4 is an introduction to Javascript. We learned about a few new things:

* DOM - Document Object Model

* Getting data from HTML with querySelector()

* Editing HTML markup with innerHTML and editing classes

* Creating event handlers to update the markup when a button is clicked

# Project 5: More Around the U.S.

Javascript; arrays; functions; oh, my!

For project 5 we continued adding functionality to our [Around the U.S.](https://riz3npho3nix.github.io/web_project_4) website.

Some of the new features include:

* Using a template to display repeated code on the page

* Manipulation of arrays

* using figure tag to display an image with caption

# Project 6: Validation Around the U.S.

*But will it submit?* It is so frustrating when you go to submit a form and it comes back with an error and wipes all of your hard work down the drain!

In this sprint we learned how to use JS to validate our forms in realtime so now you know if there is an issue right away. We also learned how to disable the submit option as long as there is still an issue with the form fields.

Some of the new functionality we learned includes:

* Using the builtin validityState

* Working with objects

* Creating event listeners on mouse clicks and key presses, as well as removing event listensers

# Project 7: Objects Around the U.S.

What is your object orientation?

This sprint we were fortunate to learn about OOP and how to use classes inside modules to split up JS files to a more manageable size.

Some of the specific things we learned about this sprint are:

* Classes

* Encapsulation

* Inheritance

* Polymorphism

* IIFE 

* Modules

As always, there is a link to my project below.
